# 📍 Leaflet.js Bootcamp – Aatham's Journey

## ✅ Day 3 – Circles, Polygons & Layer Groups

### 🧠 Concepts Learned:
- **L.circle()** – Draws a circle with radius in meters
- **L.polygon()** – Connects multiple lat/lng points into a closed shape
- **.bindPopup()** – Adds popups to any shape
- **L.layerGroup([...])** – Combines multiple markers/shapes into one group

### 🛠️ Tasks Completed:
- Drew a 500m circle around home with popup
- Created a polygon for neighborhood zone
- Added multiple named markers for nearby locations
- Grouped everything into a single `L.layerGroup()` and added to map

## ✅ Day 4 – Map Click Events & Dynamic Markers

### 🧠 Concepts Learned:
- **map.on('click', callback)** – Detect map click events
- **e.latlng.lat / e.latlng.lng** – Extract latitude & longitude
- **L.marker(e.latlng).addTo(map)** – Drop a marker where user clicks
- **.bindPopup(...).openPopup()** – Show lat/lng in popup dynamically

### 🛠️ Tasks Completed:
- Enabled user to click anywhere on the map and drop a marker
- Displayed exact lat/lng in popup format
- Allowed multiple dynamic markers (optional enhancement)
- Learned how to build responsive, interactive Leaflet maps

👏 **Progress**: Aatham is now capable of dynamic map interactions and basic shape drawing  
🔒 **Next Up**: Day 5 – Load GeoJSON Data + Style & Interact with It
